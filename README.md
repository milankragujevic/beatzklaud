# beatzklaud
A cloud music player for Windows. Linux support coming soon. 

## About
BeatzKlaud (pronounced BeatsCloud) was created by music lovers that were sick of having to jump through hoops to listen to music for free, on demand. BeatzKlaud was engineered with simplicity in mind, and that reflects in the design of the application as well the flow.

BeatzKlaud is made with web technologies, and uses the freely available APIs of YouTube, and Last.FM. The Application is written in JavaScript and HTML, and the supporting components in PHP. The video extractor is provided by ytdl.

All content is sourced directly from YouTube and is not hosted or linked by BeatzKlaud servers. BeatzKlaud is completely legal and plays only content licensed for online streaming.

## State of development
Currently, the application is being developed by two developers. The source code is pushed to github after a feature is tested and we are sure that it will not make your computer explode or something like that. (actually, not really, we just push after every save).

## Website
A website located at [https://musichq.xyz/](https://musichq.xyz/). There you can read the same text as here and download the latest git dump.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, first open an issue to make sure your proposed feature isn't currently being worked in. If that's the case, you can submit a pull request, and your code will be checked and integrated into the application.

Please don't put any obfuscated code or link stuff from your own domain, as that is forbidden and will not get your code into the application.

## Thanks
