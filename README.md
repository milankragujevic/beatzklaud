# beatzklaud
A cloud music player for Windows. Linux support coming soon. 

## About
BeatzKlaud (pronounced BeatsCloud) was created by music lovers that were sick of having to see ads everywhere if they wanted to listen to music for free, on demand. BeatzKlaud was engineered with simplicity in mind, and that reflects in the design of the interface. 

BeatzKlaud is made with web technologies, and uses the freely available APIs of YouTube, and Last.FM. The Application is written in JavaScript and HTML, and the server API is written in PHP. The video extractor is provided by [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl). 

## State of development
Currently, the application is being developed by two developers. The source code is pushed to github after a feature is tested and we are sure that it will not make your computer explode or something like that.

The application is currently unusable, but expect a fast development cycle. In a few weeks a release version will be ready...

## Website
A website located at [https://musichq.xyz/](https://musichq.xyz/) is temporary right now. The domain might change, and the copy text on it will change. It was made in an hour with WordPress and a free theme.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute, first open an issue to make sure your proposed feature isn't currently being worked in. If that's the case, you can submit a pull request, and your code will be checked and integrated into the application.

Please don't put any obfuscated code or link stuff from your own domain, as that is forbidden and will not get your code into the application.

## Thanks
Thanks [php-desktop](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop), youtube-dl, many others...
